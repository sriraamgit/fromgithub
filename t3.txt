Instructions to the compiler: There are three built-in annotations available in Java (@Deprecated, @Override & @SuppressWarnings) that can be used for giving certain instructions to the compiler. For example the @override annotation is used for instructing compiler that the annotated method is overriding the method. More about these built-in annotations with example is discussed in the next sections of this article.
